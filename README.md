# Java8MapImprovements
Looks at the improvements in Map interface in Java 8.

This is the accompanying code for my blog post here which looks at the performance implications of using the following `Map` additions in Java 8:

* `getOrDefault`
* `computeIfAbsent`
* `computeIfPresent`

Please note that the code uses in particular `HashMap` instances throughout.
